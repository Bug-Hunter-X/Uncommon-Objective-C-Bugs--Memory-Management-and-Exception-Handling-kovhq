In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `retain` or `copy`.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

If `myString` is assigned a value multiple times without releasing the previous value, you introduce a memory leak (retain count will increase without corresponding release).

Another issue is improper handling of delegate objects. If you don't properly nil out delegate references in `dealloc`, you can create a retain cycle, preventing objects from being deallocated. This is particularly significant when one object is the delegate of another, and vice versa.

Furthermore, exception handling can be problematic if not meticulously handled. Failure to catch potential exceptions can lead to unexpected application crashes.  Improperly using `@try`/`@catch`/`@finally` blocks might mask underlying issues, making debugging a nightmare.
